IrisMonitor
===========

What is it ?
------------

Originaly written in purpose to visualize data from an UAV through a serial wireless link, I update the tool in a clean, better organized project.

The goal is to provide an easy way to monitor what is happening in external electronic devices during their development. Of course, it can be used in lots of other ways.

Is it working ?
---------------

The original script works, but it is not a generic tool and is limited.

This new version is currently in preparation and cannot be used for the moment. But it would be a better tool than before.
